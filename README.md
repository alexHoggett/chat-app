An instant messaging application which is popular on every platform right now. This app gives you the option to join a specific room, where you will only be able to communicate to members in the same virtual room. Users can select their username and view the usernames of all other users in the room. I used sockets to ensure a constant connection between users was upheld
## ‚ö°Ô∏è Technologies used

- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.IO
- React
- React Router v6
- SASS
- Jest

## üõ† Installation and Setup

The application is split up into a React frontend and an Express API. In order to run, run both of these applications seperately and at the same time.

Firstly, install Node dependencies and run the API.

```bash
# in /server
; npm install
; npm run start
```

Then in a seperate terminal, install Node dependencies and run the React frontend.
```bash
# in /client
; npm install
; npm run start
```
